A Lock uses raspberry pi, Arduino, and a servo to control the lock system using facial recognition. This allows the user not to carry a key. Also, it is easy to register the user to the database. But the 2 main problems are running on normal Linux-based pc is ok but it will be hard to run on raspberry pi because it needs the power to run face recognition. Also, the face recognition software isn't that trustable. I won't take any responsibilities for any trouble using A Lock.
